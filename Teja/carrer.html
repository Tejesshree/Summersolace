    <h3>Take advantage of longer days</h3>
    <section>
    <article>
    <p>You know that days are longer during summer,
         but you ever thought about changing your daily 
         routine to make the most of those long 
        days? 
    </p>
    <p>Longer days mean more sunlight, and more sunlight means 
        more energy. Think about waking up at 7a.m. when it's already light out the way 
        different from waking up to a dark, cold 7 a.m. that still feels like nightmare.
        Take a full advantage of the extre energy by waking up early for a workout or 
        even just adding 30 minutes to your morning routine for some extra "me" time. 
    </p> <p class="q">"Embrace the opportunity to acquire the essential skills that will propel you to 
        new heights this summer."
